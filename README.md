# 2021_Neurofeedback

Neurofeedback models entail solving a computational problem of real-time intelligent adaptive control whereby the controller cannot directly influence the controlled process. The system must deal with two dynamic parameters; the plant response and, innovatively, the plant structure. The purpose is to develop an adaptive fuzzy approach to control the neurofeedback model that adaptively induces sensorimotor self-modulation. The base of the proposed model is a multi-objective error that uses a human agentâ€™s brain connectivity observation and pressure to control the response to modify the connectivity. We further show that classical control e.g. PID based, is insufficient to deal with this problem.

This repository include all the basic parts of our neurofeedback model based-on fNIRS. Some parts like the Human-agent depends on the Bilinear Model's repository(https://github.com/MarSH-Up/2021_BilinearModel_fNIRS), so check it out before to start runing this model.
